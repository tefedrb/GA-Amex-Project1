Technologies Used:
* HTML
* CSS
* JAVASCRIPT
* API
* AJAX
* DOM

Our approach was to first sketch an initial concept.
We researched ideas and sought inspiration via images that captured our travel forum theme. The foundation of html coupled with css allowed a smooth flow into js and API.

Major hurdles:
It was challenging at times merging with out conflicts as well as
scheduling time to access files so there wouldn't be overlap.
We leveraged each-others strengths as best we could given time alloted.
Spending too much time on small details in css.
Trying to plan out workflow without a strong understanding of API.

Unsolved problems:
* Duplicate posting
* Username not showing up on post initially
* Comments don't persist
